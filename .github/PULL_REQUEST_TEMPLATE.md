## Number claims (if any)

Compression, speedup, or memory claims **must** link a reproducible script and a committed `results.json`.

- Script path:
- Results path:
- Metric type (check one):
  - [ ] Key-byte **accounting** (`fp16_key_bytes / compressed_key_bytes`)
  - [ ] Full-KV accounting (keys + values + residual windows)
  - [ ] MLX peak memory (`mx.get_peak_memory`)
  - [ ] OS RSS / long-context OOM comparison
  - [ ] Throughput (tok/s)

Do not describe accounting ratios as resident RAM savings unless resident memory was measured.
